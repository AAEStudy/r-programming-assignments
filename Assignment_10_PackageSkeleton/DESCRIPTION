Description: A script for automatically running and summarizing every possible
    mediation analysis for any number of specified variables in a dataset. 
    The package interfaces with Python's 'pyprocessmacro' through 
    'reticulate' for fast and efficient estimation of indirect and direct effects, 
    bootstrapped confidence intervals, and output to a csv file. 
    Designed for anyone who frequently tests mediation models with many predictors, 		             	 
    mediators, and outcomes.
